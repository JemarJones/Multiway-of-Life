# Multiway-of-Life

Multiway of Life is a take on the [cellular automaton Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a concept where the only thing that exists are a series of cells and a set of rules that govern their survival. When a certain region is over or under populated, the cells in that region die. When the nearby population is balanced just right, they live. In our take on the classic game, each player creates their own species of cells, and they are pitted against each other in an epic war of evolution and natural selection.
